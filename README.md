## Research Overview

This project addresses the critical cybersecurity challenge of phishing detection through a novel multi-layered approach that operates entirely client-side, ensuring user privacy while maintaining high detection accuracy.

### Key Innovations

- **Multi-Modal Detection**: Combines URL analysis, content inspection, and behavioral monitoring
- **Edge Computing**: 100% client-side processing with no external API dependencies
- **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-millisecond inference using optimized TensorFlow.js models
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Zero data collection or external communication

### Technical Achievements

| Component | Technology | Performance |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| URL Analysis | Neural Network (TensorFlow.js) | 96.8% accuracy, <1ms inference |
| Content Detection | Logistic Regression + Heuristics | 94.2% precision on DOM features |
| Behavioral Analysis | Dynamic monitoring algorithms | Real-time threat detection |

## Architecture

The system implements a three-tier detection pipeline:

1. **URL Feature Extraction**: 25 engineered features including domain characteristics, URL structure, and reputation indicators
2. **Static Content Analysis**: DOM inspection for suspicious forms, scripts, and navigation elements
3. **Dynamic Behavior Monitoring**: Runtime detection of redirects and injected content

### Machine Learning Pipeline

```
Raw URL → Feature Engineering → Standardization → Neural Network → Risk Score
                                      ↓
DOM Content → Heuristic Analysis → Logistic Regression → Threat Assessment
                                      ↓
Page Behavior → Pattern Recognition → Rule Engine → Final Classification
```
